# Non-Contact-Based-Monitoring-of-Vital-Physiological-Parameters


The traditional existing methods of blood pressure measurement techniques involves cuff-based technology and is cannot be used for continuous monitoring. To overcome this, a cuffless, non-contact measurement of blood pressure measurement technique which uses facial videos of the patient obtained from a regular smartphone is proposed in this paper.

It is based on remote PPG (Polyplethysmography) technique. Leveraging features extracted from the PPG signal, an individualâ€™s BP can be estimated using a neural network. Experiments were performed on 15 human participants under different lighting and environmental conditions. The experiment protocol involved different physical activities given as tasks with appropriate buffering period. 

The PPG signal was extracted from the facial video of the subjects and systolic peaks, diastolic peaks and IBI values were calculated from it. The proposed technique can be easily extended to the camera on any mobile phone and thus can be used widely in an extensive manner.
